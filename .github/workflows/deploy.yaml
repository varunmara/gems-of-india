# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that defines the continuous integration
# and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process for a Next.js application.
# It automates the process of building and deploying the application to a
# DigitalOcean droplet when code is pushed to the 'main' branch.

name: Deploy Next.js App to DigitalOcean

# This section defines the trigger for the workflow.
# The 'on' keyword specifies that this workflow will run on a 'push' event.
# The 'branches' filter ensures it only runs for pushes to the 'main' branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # The 'deploy' job encapsulates all the steps required to build and deploy the app.
  deploy:
    environment: production
    # This specifies that the job will run on the latest version of a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This section defines the sequence of steps that the job will execute.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code.
      # This action downloads a copy of your repository onto the runner,
      # making your source code available for the subsequent steps.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up pnpm.
      # This action installs pnpm and makes it available to the workflow.
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 8 # Or your desired pnpm version

      # Step 3: Set up the Node.js environment.
      # This action installs a specific version of Node.js on the runner.
      # It's configured to use pnpm for caching, which is more efficient.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "22.x"
          cache: "pnpm" # Cache dependencies managed by pnpm.

      # Step 4: Install project dependencies with pnpm.
      # This command reads the 'package.json' and 'pnpm-lock.yaml' files
      # and installs all the necessary packages for your application.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      # Step 5: Build the Next.js application.
      # This command runs the 'build' script defined in your 'package.json'.
      # It compiles your Next.js application for production.
      # The 'env' section injects your production environment variables,
      # which are stored securely as GitHub Secrets.
      - name: Build application
        run: pnpm run build
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOADTHING_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOADTHING_URL }}

      # This redundant step has been removed for a cleaner workflow.
      # The file syncing is handled by the next step.

      # Step 6: Prepare deployment package
      # This step creates a clean directory with the exact file structure
      # needed for production. This avoids rsync issues with multiple sources.
      - name: Prepare deployment package
